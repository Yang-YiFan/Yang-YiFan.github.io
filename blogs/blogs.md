# Blogs

I plan to write blogs during my process of learning CUDA/Cutlass/Cute/Triton programming. Stay tuned for more!

- ### [[Latest] GPU Memory Consistency Model](./memory_model/memory_model.md)
- ### [Tensor Core MMA Swizzle Layout](./mma_swizzle/mma_swizzle.md)
- ### [Using Programmatic Dependent Launch (PDL) to Reduce End-to-End Latency](./pdl/pdl.md)
- ### [CuTe Layout and Tensor](./cute_layout/cute_layout.md)
- ### [How to Make a Compute-bound Problem Actually Compute-bound](./reg_tile/reg_tile.md)
- ### [Using TMA Load, Prefetch, and Multicast Load in CuTe](./cute_tma/cute_tma.html)
